This file describes the terms under which libreprobe is distributed.


Redistribution
==============
If you have received the libreprobe source, you can run it without license
that instead is required for binary packages for which we provide
support.

If you have received the libreprobe source as a research/academic institution,
you are requested not to distribute the source outside your
institution, or not distribute it at all.


/* ************** IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ************** */

libreprobe is (C) 2002-14 by Luca Deri <deri@ntop.org> that is
distributed under GNU GPL who owns the libreprobe intellectual property
and copyright (beside the sFlow collector code).

If you wish to integrate or embed libreprobe into a proprietary software
or an embedded software/hardware solution such as the nBox, be
aware that we offer alternative licenses that allow you to do that.
Please contact license@ntop.org.

GPL requires that any work derived from a GPL licensed work
(as libreprobe) must also be distributed under GPL. As the term
"derivative work" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work)
is not entirely clear we want to clarify this concept in the case of
libreprobe. We consider a derivated work of libreprobe for the purpose of
this license if it does any of the following:
- Integrates (even partially) libreprobe source code
- Includes (even partially) libreprobe copyrighted data files
- Integrates/embeds libreprobe into a binary installer/application
- Includes the libreprobe into an appliance, router or similar device
- Links (even through libreprobe's plugins) to a library that is not
  available under GPL
- Executes libreprobe and uses the produced results (usually flows
  either on the network, disk or database)

Note that the list applies to both libreprobe "as a whole" and also
to portions of it. The above list is not exhaustive but it's
used to clarify the term derivative work with respect to libreprobe.
This means that:
- nothing prevents you from distributing a proprietary product
  (either appliance, GUI front-end, or application) based on
  libreprobe. Just sell/distribute it *without* libreprobe, and point
  your customers to http://www.ntop.org/products/libreprobe/ in order
  to have access to libreprobe.
- you cannot include libreprobe into a non-GPL derivative work.

Note that the above is a clarification of what we mean for
"derivative work" in the scope of the GPL-licensed libreprobe.
This interpretation applies only to libreprobe and not to any
other GPL products.

if you have questions about libreprobe licensing please
contact license@ntop.org

See COPYING and EULA files for more details.

Note that the EULA applies *only* to libreprobe derived work.
